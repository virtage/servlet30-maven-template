= Real-world Servlet 3.0 Maven Template

Unfortunatelly Maven still offers extremely old Java servlet web application
archetype (template). It's a pain to prepare up-to-date Servlet 3.0 again and again.
So we did it for lazy beings like we are.

Template offers ready-to-use project with

* Servlet 3.0 + JSP 2.2 APIs
* JSTL tag library
* sample servlet and JSP page
* web.xml with many set error handling, init params and JNDI for JavaMail and DataSource
* JavaMail and MariaDB JDBC driver
* sample JPA `persistence.xml`
* SLF4J/Logback with config for production and tests
* Google Guava
* latest JUnit & Mockito
* Apache Tomcat 7.x to serve your webapp at http://localhost:8080 after `mvn tomcat7:run`
  with hot-reloading
